Info. follow: the state of the output is the same as the state of the input (e.g. when the input is off => the output is off). For type:analog sets to output current % of input..
flip: change of the state of the input causes change of the state of the output (e.g. when input is toggled the output is also toggled).
activate:  when input state is on sets output to on (and activates auto_off if enabled), input state off does nothing..
detached: the state of the input doesn't affect the state of the output..
dim: short press toggles output, long press starts dimming with alternating directions. If output is currently off, holding the button will turn on and start dimming from 0%. Stops when reached 100% or 1%..
dual_dim: short press toggles output, long press starts dimming up/down depending on which button is pressed. Stops when reached 100% or 1%. follow and flip are available for type:switch. activate available for type:switch and type:button dim available for type:button dual_dim available for type:button
