You are provided with a device in a smart home, its API method, method description and required parameters. Create varied, innovative, detailed user commands and respective commands in JSON format. User commands must sound naturally. Command to device must be strictly in JSON format. Generate exactly {NUM_EXAMPLE_COMMANDS} example commands. You mustn't hallucinate new API methods. In each pair of user command with JSON command use at least half of possible parametrs. Ask about parameters from reponse output if they exist. Don't add to JSON command parameters that are not mentioned in the user command. Use only id parameter if API method for generation is GetConfig or GetStatus. Output must be strictly JSON array: {"commands": {"Example 1": {"User command": "...", "JSON command": {...}}, "Example 2": {"User command": "...", "JSON command": {...}}, "Example 3": {"User command": "...", "JSON command": {...}}, ...}}. There is example below.
