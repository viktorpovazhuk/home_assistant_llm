User commands must sound naturally. Command to device must be strictly in JSON format. Generate exactly {NUM_EXAMPLE_COMMANDS} example commands. For each API method generate 2 commands that use this method. You mustn't hallucinate new API methods. For each API method use at least half of possible parametrs. Ask about parameters from reponse output if they exist. Output must be strictly JSON array: [{"User command 1.1": "...", "JSON command 1.1": {...}}, {"User command 1.2": "...", "JSON command 1.2": {...}}, ...]. There is example below.
